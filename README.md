# Pantry Pal
The final project for CS2043 - Introduction to Software Engineering.

Pantry Pal is an ingredient-matching application. Input a sequence of ingredients and receive a list of best-matched recipes in return.

**Features:**
- Add custom ingredients and recipes
- Recipes highlight which ingredients are missing
- Quick search: Input a single ingredient to receive all recipes that contain it.
- Favorites: toggle recipes as favorite and find them in your favorites list.
- Cook time search: Search through recipes by cook time.
- Shopping list: Choose a list of recipes to receive a list of missing ingredients.

App should be run from app/build/libs, with the package matching your operating system. Jar build is standalone and can be transferred to any other location as long as java 17 is present.
gradlew run will clear saved data during tests. 
Automatic builds are saved under the "Run builds on merge" action, and precompiled jars can be acquired through the artifacts there.
