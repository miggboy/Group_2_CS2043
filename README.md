# CS2043-Project
This project is the final project for CS2043.

Please create and use branches and pull requests, do *not* push directly to main.

App should be run from app/build/libs, with the package matching your operating system. Jar build is standalone and can be transferred to any other location as long as java 17 is present.
gradlew run will clear saved data during tests. 
Automatic builds are saved under the "Run builds on merge" action, and precompiled jars can be acquired through the artifacts there.
