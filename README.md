# CS2043-Project
This project is the final project for CS2043 - Introduction to Software Engineering.

Pantry Pal is an ingredient-matching application. Input a sequence of ingredients and receive a list of best-matched recipes in return.

App should be run from app/build/libs, with the package matching your operating system. Jar build is standalone and can be transferred to any other location as long as java 17 is present.
gradlew run will clear saved data during tests. 
Automatic builds are saved under the "Run builds on merge" action, and precompiled jars can be acquired through the artifacts there.
